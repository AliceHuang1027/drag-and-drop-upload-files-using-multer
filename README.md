# drag-and-drop-upload-files-using-multer
Hi humans,

Alice here, I am working on building a drag-and-drop file upload app by using multer. 

In this project, I will have a server which is server.js in my primary folder.

Plus, there will be a front-end file : index.html, in which drag, dragleave, and drop functions will be built for clients.

Once i initiate the project, there will be a package.json generated; once i install express, multer libraries, a folder named node-modules will be genereated and these dependencies will be shown in package.json.

So the idea is once user send a request to localhost:8080/, the server will send the index.html front-end file to the browser, and once the user drap files to the page, the page will turn green with text: for instance "dragged 3 files" on it.

Then once user drop it, the screen turn back to clear and files will be uploaded to the file in server named uploads.
